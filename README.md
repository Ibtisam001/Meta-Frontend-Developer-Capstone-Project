# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Overview:
This website was created as the final project for Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course, culminating the skills learned throughout the Front-End Development Track. It highlights my ability to build a booking application using React components, demonstrating a strong grasp of modern web development practices.

The core feature of this website is the "Reserve a Table" functionality, which is fully implemented and functional. Additionally, the project includes API integration, showcasing the ability to work with external data sources within a React framework.
## Screenshots:
Below are screenshots of the application, emphasizing the Booking functionality.
